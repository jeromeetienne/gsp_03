- issue if the user changes the groups after having created the visual
  - this would require to detect when the groups changes
  - find examples to test the groups
- BUG: if i dont draw a visual which were there before, it is never removed from the renderer

- make transform chain
  - download
  - make one user space `TransformLinkImmediate`
- the attributes check system for all visual
  - should be done in the renderer too (post transformation)
  - static .sanity_check_attributes()
  - non static .check_attributes()
  - non static .set_attributes()
- generate or write a .pyi files for the new classes

- DONE make the groups in pixels and points
- DONE make groups computation in core with common functions
- DONE make the 3d transformations in pixels and points
- DONE implement Pixels
- DONE write a simple example using Pixels
- support math operations
  - make the pixels rotate
- find a way to generate the .pyi files automatically
- update documentation
